- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Category choice influences question generation

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Welcome and Configuration Loading

#### EXECUTION RULES:
