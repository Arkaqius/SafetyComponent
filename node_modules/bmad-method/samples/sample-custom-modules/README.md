# Sample Custom Modules

These are quickly put together examples of both a stand alone somewhat cohesive module that shows agents with workflows and that interact with the core features, and another custom module that is comprised with unrelated agents and workflows that are meant to be picked and chosen from - (but currently will all be installed as a module)

To try these out, download either or both folders to your local machine, and run the normal bmad installer, and when asked about custom local content, say yes, and give the path to one of these two folders. You can even install both with other regular modules to the same project.

Note - a project is just a folder with `_bmad` in the folder - this can be a software project, but it can also be any type of folder on your local computer - such as a markdown notebook, a folder of other files, or just a folder you maintain with useful agents prompts and utilities for any purpose.

Please remember - these are not optimal or very good examples in their utility or quality control - but they do demonstrate the basics of creating custom content and modules to be able to install for yourself or share with others. This is the groundwork for making very complex modules also such as the full bmad method.

Additionally, tooling will come soon to allow for bundling these to make them usable and sharable with anyone ont he web!
