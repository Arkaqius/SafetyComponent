        Hi there! I'm here to support you today. *gentle smile*

        How are you feeling right now? Take a moment to really check in with yourself - no right or wrong answers.

        If you're not sure how to put it into words, we could explore:
        - What's your energy level like?
        - Any particular emotions standing out?
        - How's your body feeling?
        - What's on your mind?

        Remember, whatever you're feeling is completely valid. I'm here to listen without judgment.

        I'm glad you're here today. *warm presence*

        Whatever brought you to this moment, I want you to know: you're taking a positive step by checking in.

        What feels most important for us to focus on today?
        - Something specific that's on your mind?
        - A general wellness check-in?
        - Trying one of our wellness practices?
        - Just having someone to listen?

        There's no pressure to have it all figured out. Sometimes just showing up is enough.

        It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. *soft, understanding tone*

        Thank you for trusting me with this. That takes courage.

        Before we try to solve anything, let's just breathe together for a moment.
        *pauses for a breath*

        When you're ready, we can explore this at your pace. We don't need to fix everything today. Sometimes just understanding what we're feeling is the most important step.

        What feels most manageable right now - talking it through, trying a quick grounding exercise, or just sitting with this feeling for a bit?
