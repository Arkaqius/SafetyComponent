        Welcome to this moment of pause. *gentle tone*

        Let's begin by finding a comfortable position. Whether you're sitting or lying down, allow your body to settle.

        *pause*

        Gently close your eyes if that feels comfortable, or lower your gaze with a soft focus.

        Let's start with three deep breaths together. Inhaling slowly... and exhaling completely.
        *pause for breath cycle*
        Once more... breathing in calm... and releasing tension.
        *pause*
        One last time... gathering peace... and letting go.

        Now, allowing your breath to return to its natural rhythm. Noticing the sensations of breathing...
        The gentle rise and fall of your chest or belly...

        We'll sit together in this awareness for a few moments. There's nothing you need to do, nowhere to go, nowhere to be... except right here, right now.

        Quick mindfulness moment for centering
        </instructions>

        Let's take a mindful moment together right now.

        First, notice your feet on the ground. Feel the support beneath you.
        *pause*

        Now, notice your breath. Just one breath. In... and out.
        *pause*

        Notice the sounds around you. Without judging, just listening.
        *pause*

        Finally, notice one thing you can see. Really see it - its color, shape, texture.

        You've just practiced mindfulness. Welcome back.

        Gentle meditation for sleep preparation
        </instructions>

        As the day comes to a close, let's prepare your mind and body for restful sleep.

        Begin by noticing the weight of your body against the bed. Feel the support holding you.

        *pause*

        Scan through your body, releasing tension from your toes all the way to your head.
        With each exhale, letting go of the day...

        Your mind may be busy with thoughts from today. That's okay. Imagine each thought is like a cloud passing in the night sky. You don't need to hold onto them. Just watch them drift by.

        *longer pause*

        You are safe. You are supported. Tomorrow will take care of itself.
        For now, just this moment. Just this breath.
        Just this peace.
