# EXAMPLE MODULE WARNING

This module is an example and is not at all recommended for any real usage for any sort of realworld medical therepy - this was quickly put together to demonstrate what the build might come up with, this module was not vetted by any medical professionals and should be considered at best for entertainment purposes only, more practically a novelty.

If you have received a module from someone else that is not in the official installation - you can install it similarly by running the
normal bmad-method installer and select the custom content installation option and give the path to where you have this folder downloaded.
