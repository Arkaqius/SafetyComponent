### Idea: Add search functionality to customer dashboard

**P**roblem:  
Customers can't find their past orders quickly. They have to scroll through pages of orders to find what they're looking for, leading to 15+ support tickets per week.

**A**udience:  
All 5,000+ active customers are affected. Support team spends ~10 hours/week helping customers find orders.

**S**olution:  
Add a search bar that filters by order number, date range, and product name. Success = 50% reduction in order-finding support tickets within 2 weeks of launch.

**S**ize:

- [x] **M** - 3-5 days

## Tips for Success

1. **Be specific** - Vague problems lead to vague solutions
2. **Quantify when possible** - Numbers help us prioritize (e.g., "20 customers asked for this" vs "customers want this")
3. **One idea per submission** - If you have multiple ideas, submit multiple templates
4. **Success metrics matter** - How will we know this worked?
5. **Honest sizing** - Better to overestimate than underestimate
