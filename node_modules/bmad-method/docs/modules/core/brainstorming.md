**Facilitate structured creative sessions using 60+ proven ideation techniques.**

The Brainstorming workflow is an interactive facilitation system that helps you unlock your own creativity. The AI acts as coach, guide, and creative partner—using proven techniques to draw out ideas and insights that are already within you.

## Workflow Integration

Brainstorming is a core workflow designed to be invoked and configured by other modules. When called from another workflow, it accepts contextual parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Topic focus** | What the brainstorming should help discover or solve |
| **Guardrails** | Constraints, boundaries, or must-avoid areas |
| **Output goals** | What the final output needs to accomplish for the calling workflow |
| **Context files** | Project-specific guidance to inform technique selection |

### Example

When creating a new module in the BMad Builder workflow, Brainstorming can be invoked with guardrails around the module's purpose and a goal to discover key features, user needs, or architectural considerations. The session becomes focused on producing exactly what the module creation workflow needs.
