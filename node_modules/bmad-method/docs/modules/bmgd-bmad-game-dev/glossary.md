# BMGD Glossary

Key game development terminology used in BMGD workflows.

---

## A

### Acceptance Criteria

Specific conditions that must be met for a story to be considered complete. Defines "done" for implementation.

### Act Structure

Story organization into major sections (typically 3 acts: Setup, Confrontation, Resolution).

---

## B

### Backlog

List of pending work items (epics, stories) waiting to be scheduled and implemented.

### Boss Design

Design of significant enemy encounters, typically featuring unique mechanics and increased challenge.

---

## C

### Character Arc

The transformation a character undergoes through the story, from initial state to final state.

### Core Fantasy

The emotional experience players seek from your game. What they want to FEEL.

### Core Loop

The fundamental cycle of actions players repeat throughout gameplay. The heart of your game.

---

## D

### Definition of Done (DoD)

Checklist of requirements that must be satisfied before work is considered complete.

### Design Pillar

Core principle that guides all design decisions. Typically 3-5 pillars define a game's identity.

---

## E

### Environmental Storytelling

Narrative communicated through the game world itself—visual details, audio, found documents—rather than explicit dialogue.

### Epic

Large body of work that can be broken down into smaller stories. Represents a major feature or system.

---

## F

### Frame Data

In fighting games, the precise timing information for moves (startup, active, recovery frames).

### Frontmatter

YAML metadata at the beginning of markdown files, used for workflow state tracking.

---

## G

### Game Brief

Document capturing the game's core vision, pillars, target audience, and scope. Foundation for the GDD.

### Game Design Document (GDD)

Comprehensive document detailing all aspects of game design: mechanics, systems, content, and more.

### Game Type

Genre classification that determines which specialized GDD sections are included.

---

## H

### Hot Path

Code that executes frequently (every frame). Must be optimized for performance.

---

## I

### Idle Progression

Game mechanics where progress continues even when the player isn't actively playing.

---

## K

### Kishotenketsu

Four-act story structure from East Asian narrative tradition (Introduction, Development, Twist, Conclusion).

---

## L

### Localization

Adapting game content for different languages and cultures.

---

## M

### MDA Framework

Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics. Framework for analyzing and designing games.

### Meta-Progression

Persistent progression that carries between individual runs or sessions.

### Metroidvania

Genre featuring interconnected world exploration with ability-gated progression.

---

## N

### Narrative Complexity

How central story is to the game experience (Critical, Heavy, Moderate, Light).

### Netcode

Networking code handling multiplayer communication and synchronization.

---

## P

### Permadeath

Game mechanic where character death is permanent, typically requiring a new run.

### Player Agency

The degree to which players can make meaningful choices that affect outcomes.

### Procedural Generation

Algorithmic creation of game content (levels, items, characters) rather than hand-crafted.

---

## R

### Retrospective

Team meeting after completing work to reflect on what went well and what to improve.

### Roguelike

Genre featuring procedural generation, permadeath, and run-based progression.

### Run

A single playthrough in a roguelike or run-based game, from start to death/completion.

---

## S

### Sprint

Time-boxed period of development work, typically 1-2 weeks.

### Sprint Status

Tracking document showing current sprint progress, story states, and blockers.

### Story

Smallest unit of implementable work with clear acceptance criteria. Part of an epic.

### Story Context

Assembled documentation and code context needed to implement a specific story.

### Story Gates

Points where story progression is blocked until certain gameplay conditions are met.

---

## T

### Tech Spec

Technical specification document detailing how a feature will be implemented.

### TDD (Test-Driven Development)

Development approach: write tests first, then implement code to pass them.

---

## U

### UI/UX

User Interface / User Experience. How players interact with and experience the game.

---

## V

### Visual Novel

Genre focused on narrative with static images, dialogue, and player choices.

### Voice Acting

Recorded spoken dialogue for game characters.

---

## W

### Workflow

Structured process for completing a specific type of work (e.g., GDD creation, story implementation).

### Workflow Status

Current state of project workflows, tracking which phases and documents are complete.

### World Building

Creation of the game's setting, including history, culture, geography, and lore.

---

## BMGD-Specific Terms

### A/P/C Menu

Options presented after content generation:

- **A** - Advanced Elicitation (explore deeper)
- **P** - Party Mode (multi-agent discussion)
- **C** - Continue (save and proceed)

### Narrative Complexity Levels

- **Critical** - Story IS the game (visual novels)
- **Heavy** - Deep narrative with gameplay (RPGs)
- **Moderate** - Meaningful story supporting gameplay
- **Light** - Minimal story, gameplay-focused

### Step-File Architecture

BMGD workflow pattern using separate markdown files for each workflow step.

### Workflow-Install Pattern

Phase 4 workflows inherit from BMM base and add BMGD-specific overrides.
