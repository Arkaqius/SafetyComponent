## Getting Started

**New to BMGD?** Start here:

- **[Quick Start Guide](./quick-start.md)** - Get started building your first game
  - Installation and setup
  - Understanding the game development phases
  - Running your first workflows
  - Agent-based development flow

**Quick Path:** Install BMGD module → Game Brief → GDD → Architecture → Build

  - Agent roles and when to use them
  - Agent workflows and menus

- **[Workflows Guide](./workflows-guide.md)** - Complete workflow reference
  - Phase 1: Preproduction (Brainstorm, Game Brief)
  - Phase 2: Design (GDD, Narrative)
  - Phase 3: Technical (Architecture)
  - Phase 4: Production (Sprint-based development)

- **[Game Types Guide](./game-types-guide.md)** - Selecting and using game type templates
  - 24 supported game types
  - Genre-specific GDD sections
  - Hybrid game type handling

- **[Quick-Flow Guide](./quick-flow-guide.md)** - Fast-track workflows for rapid development

## Choose Your Path

### I need to...

**Start a new game project**
→ Start with [Quick Start Guide](./quick-start.md)
→ Run `brainstorm-game` for ideation
→ Create a Game Brief with `create-brief`

**Design my game**
→ Create a GDD with `create-gdd`
→ If story-heavy, add Narrative Design with `create-narrative`

**Plan the technical architecture**
→ Run `create-architecture` with the Game Architect

**Build my game**
→ Use Phase 4 production workflows
→ Follow the sprint-based development cycle

**Quickly test an idea or implement a feature**
→ Use [Quick-Flow](./quick-flow-guide.md) for rapid prototyping and development
→ `quick-prototype` to test mechanics, `quick-dev` to implement

**Set up testing and QA**
→ Use Game QA agent for test framework setup
→ Run `test-framework` to initialize testing for Unity/Unreal/Godot
→ Use `test-design` to create test scenarios
→ Plan playtests with `playtest-plan`

**Understand game type templates**
→ See [Game Types Guide](./game-types-guide.md)

## Game Development Phases

BMGD follows four phases aligned with game development:

![BMGD Workflow Overview](./workflow-overview.jpg)

### Phase 1: Preproduction

- **Brainstorm Game** - Ideation with game-specific techniques
- **Game Brief** - Capture vision, market, and fundamentals

### Phase 2: Design

- **GDD (Game Design Document)** - Comprehensive game design
- **Narrative Design** - Story, characters, world (for story-driven games)

### Phase 3: Technical

- **Game Architecture** - Engine, systems, patterns, structure

### Phase 4: Production

- **Sprint Planning** - Epic and story management
- **Story Development** - Implementation workflow
- **Code Review** - Quality assurance
- **Testing** - Automated tests, playtesting, performance
- **Retrospective** - Continuous improvement

## BMGD vs BMM

BMGD extends BMM with game-specific capabilities:

| Aspect         | BMM                                   | BMGD                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Focus**      | General software                      | Game development                                                         |
| **Agents**     | PM, Architect, Dev, SM, TEA, Solo Dev | Game Designer, Game Dev, Game Architect, Game SM, Game QA, Game Solo Dev |
| **Planning**   | PRD, Tech Spec                        | Game Brief, GDD                                                          |
| **Types**      | N/A                                   | 24 game type templates                                                   |
| **Narrative**  | N/A                                   | Full narrative workflow                                                  |
| **Testing**    | Web-focused testarch                  | Engine-specific (Unity, Unreal, Godot)                                   |
| **Production** | Inherited from BMM                    | BMM workflows with game overrides                                        |

BMGD production workflows inherit from BMM and add game-specific checklists and templates.
