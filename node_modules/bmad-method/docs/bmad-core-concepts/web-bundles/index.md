# Web Bundles

Use BMAD agents in Gemini Gems and Custom GPTs.

## Status

> **Note:** The Web Bundling Feature is being rebuilt from the ground up. Current v6 bundles may be incomplete or missing functionality.

## What Are Web Bundles?

Web bundles package BMad agents as self-contained files that work in Gemini Gems and Custom GPTs. Everything the agent needs - instructions, workflows, dependencies - is bundled into a single file for easy upload.

### What's Included

- Complete agent persona and instructions
- All workflows and dependencies
- Interactive menu system
- Party mode for multi-agent collaboration
- No external files required

### Use Cases

**Perfect for:**
- Uploading a single file to a Gemini GEM or Custom GPT
- Using BMAD Method from the Web
- Cost savings (generally lower cost than local usage)
- Quick sharing of agent configurations

**Trade-offs:**
- Some quality reduction vs local usage
- Less convenient than full local installation
- Limited to agent capabilities (no workflow file access)
