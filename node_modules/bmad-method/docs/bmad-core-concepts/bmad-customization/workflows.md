# Workflow Customization Guide

Customize and optimize workflows with step replacement and hooks.

## Status

> **Coming Soon:** Workflow customization is an upcoming capability. This guide will be updated when the feature is available.

## What to Expect

Workflow customization will allow you to:

- **Replace Steps** - Swap out specific workflow steps with custom implementations
- **Add Hooks** - Inject custom behavior before/after workflow steps
- **Extend Workflows** - Create new workflows based on existing ones
- **Override Behavior** - Customize workflow logic for your project's needs

## For Now

While workflow customization is in development, you can:

- **Create Custom Workflows** - Use the BMAD Builder to create entirely new workflows
- **Customize Agents** - Modify agent behavior using [Agent Customization](./agents.md)
- **Provide Feedback** - Share your workflow customization needs with the community

---

**In the meantime:** Learn how to [create custom workflows](../../modules/bmb-bmad-builder/index) from scratch.
