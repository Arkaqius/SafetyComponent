        Focus on inconsistencies, contradictions, edge cases and serious issues.
        Avoid commenting on minor issues such as linting, formatting and style issues.
        When providing code suggestions, use GitHub's suggestion format:
        ```suggestion
        <code changes>
        ```
    - path: "**/*.js"
      instructions: |
        CLI tooling code. Check for: missing error handling on fs operations,
        path.join vs string concatenation, proper cleanup in error paths.
        Flag any process.exit() without error message.
