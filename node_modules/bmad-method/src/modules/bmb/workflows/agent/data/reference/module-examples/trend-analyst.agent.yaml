#
# WHY THIS IS A MODULE AGENT (not just location):
# - Designed FOR CIS ecosystem (Creative Intelligence & Strategy)
# - Uses/contributes CIS workflows (trend-scan, trend-analysis, opportunity-mapping)
# - Coordinates with other CIS agents (innovation-strategist, storyteller, design-thinking-coach)
# - Included in default CIS bundle
# This is design intent and integration, not capability limitation.
