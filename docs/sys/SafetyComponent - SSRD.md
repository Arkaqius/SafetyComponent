- **Includes**: Safety runtime (SafetyFunctions), shared SafetyComponent framework, TemperatureComponent MVP, supporting managers (Fault, Notification, Recovery, DerivativeMonitor), configuration handling, and test harness.
- **Excludes**: Frontend UI, non-safety automations, hardware certification, hazard analysis (covered in HARA), and deployment tooling.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

- Software architects & developers adding safety components or extending platform.
- V\&V engineers planning unit, integration, and end-to-end drills.
- Safety managers tracking ASPICE coverage against SYS/HARA.

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Logical Components

- **SafetyFunctions (AppDaemon app)**: Orchestrator; loads config; instantiates components; wires FM/NM/RM; sets health entity.
- **SafetyComponent (abstract base)**: Provides SM lifecycle, debouncing, FM integration, decorator for enable/disable & retries.
- **TemperatureComponent (MVP)**: Implements under-temperature & forecast SMs.
- **FaultManager**: Owns Symptom/Fault models, aggregates, manages lifecycle.
- **NotificationManager**: Maps fault lifecycle to HA notify service.
- **RecoveryManager**: Orchestrates recovery actions, resolves conflicts.
- **DerivativeMonitor**: Singleton calculating derivatives, publishing `_rate` entities.
- **CommonEntities**: Accessor for shared HA entities.

### 4.2 Data Flow Summary

1. YAML config ‚Üí SafetyFunctions ‚Üí component factory.
2. Components register SMs; decorator handles debounce + FM.
3. HA triggers SM; SafetyComponent ‚Üí FM.
4. FM updates Fault state ‚Üí NM + RM.
5. RM executes recovery actions; NM sends notifications.
6. DerivativeMonitor runs periodically; outputs consumed by TC forecast SM.

### 4.3 Deployment

- Runs in HA/AppDaemon container.
- Interfaces: `set_state`, `listen_state`, `run_in`, `run_every`, `call_service`.
- Debugging: `remote_pdb` when enabled.

## 5. Detailed Design

### 5.1 SafetyFunctions

- Initialization: Load YAML, instantiate components, wire FM/NM/RM, expose entities.
- Issues: Hard-coded component dict; no shutdown hooks; no mode management.

### 5.2 SafetyComponent Base

- Responsibilities: Debounce logic, FM integration, SM decorator.
- Issues: Tight HA scheduler coupling; no timeout; hidden dependency on DerivativeMonitor.

### 5.3 TemperatureComponent

- SMs: `sm_tc_1` (threshold), `sm_tc_2` (forecast).
- Concerns: Intermixed config parsing; no high-temperature support; silent skips on missing config.

### 5.4 FaultManager

- Aggregates faults; enables/disables SMs; updates system state.
- Concerns: Accesses component internals; lacks persistence/evidence logging.

### 5.5 NotificationManager

- Formats & sends HA notifications.
- Concerns: Level 3/4 not handled; embedded notification structure; unstructured logging.

### 5.6 RecoveryManager

- Executes/validates recovery actions.
- Concerns: Coupled to HA listeners; lacks state machine clarity; needs hazard awareness.

### 5.7 DerivativeMonitor

- Singleton; calculates derivatives.
- Concerns: Retains state across reloads; no reset; test issues; no error handling.

### 5.8 Config Handling

- Parsed in SafetyFunctions; passed raw to components.
- Concerns: No schema validation; hard-coded component mapping.

### 5.9 Logging & Diagnostics

- Basic `log` calls; no structured fields; no self-test/watchdog.

### 5.10 Modes & Safe States

- SYS defines modes; none implemented.

---

## 6. Testing

### 6.1 Current Coverage

- Pytest covers TC, FM, NM, RM with mocks.
- Relies on heavy HA mocking.

### 6.2 Testability Concerns

- Real listener registration; singleton state leakage; scheduler coupling.

### 6.3 Future Strategy

- Introduce adapter interfaces for HA services.
- Reset hooks for singletons.
- Extend tests for config errors, recovery conflicts, notification clearing.

---

## 7. Improvement Backlog

1. Dynamic component registration (no hard-coding).
2. Config schema & validation layer.
3. Mode management state machine.
4. Timeout & watchdog for SMs.
5. Structured logging + evidence persistence.
6. Extend hazards (over-temp, fire, gas, water, etc.).
7. RecoveryManager refactor (conflict handling, hazard-aware).
8. DerivativeMonitor lifecycle reset.
9. Complete notification levels 3/4.
10. Self-diagnostics & health metrics.

---

## 8. Traceability

- Hazard ‚Üî Requirement linkage maintained in SYS/HARA.
- Current implementation covers **Cold Exposure hazard (HARA ¬ß1.1)**.
- Trace matrix to be expanded as new hazard components are added.

---

## 9. Document Control

- **Owner**: Safety Architecture / Development Team.
- **Version**: 0.2.0 (merged SSRD + SafetyComponent doc).
- **Status**: Working draft; baseline for multi-hazard expansion.

---

‚úÖ This combined doc unifies both sources. It keeps SSRD structure (purpose ‚Üí context ‚Üí requirements ‚Üí architecture ‚Üí design ‚Üí testing ‚Üí backlog ‚Üí traceability).
Do you want me to also **insert a proper traceability matrix table** (Hazard ‚Üí SYS Req ‚Üí SW Req ‚Üí Test Case) at the end, like in your SYS doc?
