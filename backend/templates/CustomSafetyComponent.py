"""
This module defines a template for a custom safety component within a Home Assistant-based safety system.
This component is responsible for monitoring specific conditions and managing safety mechanisms to mitigate risks
associated with these conditions. This template serves as a foundation to build domain-specific safety components.

Classes:
- CustomSafetyComponent: Manages custom safety mechanisms within Home Assistant.

Usage:
The CustomSafetyComponent class can be customized to implement specific monitoring and safety response
mechanisms, using Home Assistant's infrastructure to interact with sensors and execute safety actions.
