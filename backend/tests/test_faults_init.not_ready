    Test the initialization of the 'RiskyTemperature' fault in the SafetyFunctions application.

    Verifies that the 'RiskyTemperature' fault:
    - Is correctly named 'RiskyTemperature'.
    - Is initialized with a state of 'NOT_TESTED', indicating it hasn't been triggered yet.
    - Is related to the correct symptom 'sm_tc_1', which it depends on for activation.
    - Has a notification level set to '2', denoting its priority or severity.

    This test ensures that fault configurations are correctly set up during the application's
    initialization process, which is crucial for the fault management system to operate as intended.
