# Backend

## Coding Standards

Follow these conventions when working on the backend codebase:

- **Type hints**: Use type hints for function signatures, class attributes, and complex variables whenever practical.
- **PEP 8 naming**: Use `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes, and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- **Docstrings**: Add docstrings to all public modules, classes, and functions to describe purpose, inputs, and outputs.
- **Imports**: Group standard library, third-party, and local imports separately, and keep imports ordered within each group.
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Prefer explicit, readable logic and meaningful names over terse constructs.

If you are unsure about an existing pattern, check nearby modules in `backend/` and follow the established style.
