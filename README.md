# Safety Component for Home Assistant

This repository is dedicated to developing a Safety Component for the Home Assistant system. The component is designed to monitor, assess, and mitigate safety and security risks in a home environment. The repository includes documentation on hazard analysis, risk assessment, safety goals, and risk mitigation strategies for a wide range of potential hazards.  

## Features
**SafetyConcept**: Please refer to the full documentation for a comprehensive understanding of our hazard analysis and risk assessment process, as well as the risk mitigation strategies we employ.

## Testing
Automated tests are maintained under `backend/tests` and rely on the in-repo AppDaemon Hass stub for isolation. To run the full test suite:

1. Create and activate a Python 3.10+ virtual environment.
2. Install test dependencies (pytest and any project requirements) in that environment.
3. From the repository root, execute:

   ```bash
   pytest backend/tests
   ```

Recent validation: the suite was exercised locally via `pytest backend/tests`.
